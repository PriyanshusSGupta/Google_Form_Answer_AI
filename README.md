## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The extension operates by injecting a content script (`main.js`) into the Google Forms page. This script extracts the quiz questions and options, and then sends them to the configured AI provider's API. The AI's response is then used to auto-select the correct answer. Image questions are handled by first converting the image to a Base64 string and then sending it to a vision-enabled model. All key functions, including fetching, showing, and erasing answers, are triggered by simple background scripts.

## üîë Configuration

To use this extension, you must set up your API key.

1.  Open the `main.js` file in a text editor.
2.  Find the `API_CONFIG` object at the top of the file.
3.  Set your preferred provider by changing the `CURRENT_PROVIDER` variable.
    ```javascript
    const CURRENT_PROVIDER = 'GEMINI'; // Or 'OPENROUTER', 'GROQ'
    ```
4.  Paste your API key into the corresponding field within the `API_CONFIG` object.
